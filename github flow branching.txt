GitHub Flow - A simple branching process of opening new feature branches, implementing small changes + features
and merging with main if branch is working. Then delete merged branch as it is no longer needed and open a new one.

VS Code:
git branch
git checkout -b 'feature-branch'
git add .
git commit -m 'message'
git push origin 'feature-branch'

GitHub:
Go to repo pull requests tab, create new pr, select base:main compare:feature and open PR
review/resolve conflicts
merge PR
delete merged branch (to prepare for a new fresh branch)

VS Code:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d 'feature-branch' (delete branch after merging)
git push origin --delete 'feature-branch' (if you haven't deleted on GitHub)
