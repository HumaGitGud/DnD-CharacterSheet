LINUX Notes

Linux has 2 roots, 1. Linux root of all system files and 2. Super user roots personal folder.
Linux root should be left alone, whereas user root folder is usable (accessible with command: cd ~)

CLI notes:
ls, cd, pwd, ctrl+c, etc.      - standard cli commands
man ls                         - man shows command description (ls example)
apropos 'search files'         - find a command that does '...'
mkdir/rmdir 'folder'           - create/remove directories
cp/mv file.txt ../secondFolder - copy/move file to another directory
rm                             - remove file

cat, head, tail                - view text
awk, sed, sort                 - manipulate text

Vim and Nano text editor examples:
vi -> i -> type 'Hello' -> escape -> :w new.txt -> escape -> :wq(save) :q!(quit without save)
nano -> type and follow ui controls (Nano is more user friendly)

tar/zip  - archive multiple files

pipe (|) - used to connect the output of one command to the input of another command
stdin/stdout/stderr - output redirection

root - super user (full system access)
sudo - execute commands with super user privileges

rwxrwxrwx - rwx(user)rwx(owner)rwx(group)
read, write, execute
